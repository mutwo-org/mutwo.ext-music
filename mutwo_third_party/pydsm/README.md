# pydsm

*pydsm* is a "Python/Scipy toolbox for the design and simulation of ΔΣ Modulators, with emphasis on digital modulators."
The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sergiocallegari/PyDSM) and has been developed by Sergio Callegari. Because *mutwo* only makes use of the iso226 Loudness contours implementation (and doesn't need 95% of the other functionality and the cython dependency), we decided to package the respective file within *mutwo*.

*pydsm* makes use of the same license like *mutwo*. Further information regarding the license of *pydsm* can be found in the respective LICENSE file.
